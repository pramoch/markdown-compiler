# OAuth 2.0

## Introduction

In the traditional client­server authentication model, the client requests an access­ restricted resource (protected resource) on the server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's credentials. In order to provide third­party applications access to restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with the third party.
