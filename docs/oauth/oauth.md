# OAuth 2.0

## Introduction

In the traditional client­-server authentication model, the client requests an access­ restricted resource (protected resource) on the server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's credentials. In order to provide third­party applications access to restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with the third party.

This is a redirection­based flow, which means that the application must be capable of interacting with the customer(i.e. the customer on SCB Easy app) and receiving API authorization codes that are routed through the customer.
